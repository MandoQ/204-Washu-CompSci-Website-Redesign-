<img id="undergrad-pic" src="https://engineering.wustl.edu/prospective-students/undergraduate-admissions/PublishingImages/Pages/default/3-nonengineering-study.jpg" alt="admissions">

<p id="admissions-text">Today's college students want to have an impact and to make contributions toward solving national and international challenges in a variety of areas, including health, energy, environment and climate change, security, hunger, inequality, and poverty.
   Just as important, they understand they are citizens of a global society.</p>

   <p id="admissions-text">At WashU, you will see the connections between studying engineering and benefiting society. You will be in a community of innovative thinkers who want to work across disciplines to solve problems.
     You will challenge assumptions, make compelling arguments, push comfort zones, and embrace learning through mutual respect. </p>

     <p id="admissions-text">You will explore, learn, grow, and lead. Engineer your way. Engineer at WashU.</p>

     <h2 id="admin-heading">How do we make our admissions decisions?</h2>

     <p id="admissions-text">Students who come to Washington University have challenged themselves academically and personally during their high school years. Most candidates' transcripts include four years of English,
       four years of mathematics (the School of Engineering & Applied Science recommends calculus), three to four years of history and social science, three to four years of laboratory science
       (the School of Engineering & Applied Science recommends biology, chemistry, and physics), and at least two years of a foreign language. Your senior-year transcript should show
        that you are continuing to take demanding courses and are doing well in them. Most applicants take advantage of honors, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate courses -
        if offered by their high schools. We also take into consideration standardized testing, letters of recommendation, extracurricular activities, and an essay.</p>
